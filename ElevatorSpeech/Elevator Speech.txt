Hi my name is Patrick Nepp and I have created a SPA for the LGBT
community. For most people identifying as LGBT, being a part of a
community is important to them. I created “LGBcommuniT” (potential name
haha) to make it easier for LGBT people to find their community and for
those already involved, to enhance their community. There are local bars
and Pride events but there is so much more to the community and
sometimes these environments aren’t friendly or comfortable for everyone
to be a part of. This is different from other websites because it’s obviously
LGBT focused but includes so much more than just creating meetups. It
allows users to find local events, post local events, create meetups, find
safe spaces like LGBT owned and friendly businesses and find like minded
people.
